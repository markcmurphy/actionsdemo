## Storefront channels

Want to market your headless storefront as an app in BigCommerce's control panel? Use [Channels Toolkit](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/channels/guide/channels-toolkit-reference) to install a storefront channel into [Channel Manager](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Selling-Everywhere-with-Channel-Manager) during the [single-click app](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/guide/types) installation process.

[Learn how to build a storefront channel](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/channels/tutorials/storefront).

## Multisite

Use BigCommerce as the back-end for several stores. By placing an application layer between the storefront and the APIs, the application can control which catalog information is pushed to which storefront.

## Catalog Management

Using the [Catalog API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/catalog/catalog-api) you can return product data to your product details page and product listing page.

### Sync the catalog

Best practice is to get product details and cache them in a database to display them. This will speed up the application and allow you to control what information is shown to the customer. Caching the details also lets you implement search in your application.

### Real time catalog

If your catalog is changing all the time, you can use the Catalog API to return real time product information.

### Real time pricing and inventory

If you prefer working with a local copy of your data, but want to make sure that high priority pieces of data like pricing and inventory are always up to date, you can consider a hybrid model. A hybrid model would cache only certain product details and pull the other information in real time. BigCommerce has webhooks that you can use for listening to store events.

## Cart management

Use the [Server to Server Cart API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/server-server-cart-api) to create carts for existing customers and guest customers.

### Guest Cart

A guest cart assumes the shopper is not a customer and is not logging in or creating an account during checkout. Handle guest checkouts by displaying the cart data to the customer and then moving them to Checkout using the Checkout API.

### Content management system

Using a CMS is a good way to offer a custom shopper experience without needing build a content engine as well. The CMS needs to have a database so catalog information can be stored and retrieved and a way to store accounts. The [BigCommerce WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bigcommerce/) loads the catalog into the database while using an embedded checkout to display cart and checkout details to customers.

## Checkout management

Use the [Checkout API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/server-server-checkout-api) to move the cart to checkout and turn an existing checkout into an order.
